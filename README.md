WordPress San Francisco Ajax Example
======================

This is an example of an [Ajax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming) script in [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/). This was built for the [WordPress San Francisco Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wordpress-sf/) and is by NO MEANS useable, except for seeing Ajax in action.

This is for use within [Twenty Fourteen](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/08/09/2014-theme-project/).
=====================
This is only an example I put together in an hour or so, it's not purfect, but it works and gets an example of ajax rollin'.

This is accompanied by slides here [https://slid.es/colegeissinger/wpsfo-08-2013-ajax/](https://slid.es/colegeissinger/wpsfo-08-2013-ajax/)
